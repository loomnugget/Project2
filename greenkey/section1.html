<div><h1>Lawn Care</h1>
A beautiful lawn can make all the difference in the appearance of your home. The regular attention of our lawn team ensures a lush, healthy lawn for you and your family to enjoy. Lawn mowing service includes mowing the entire yard, line trimming (weedeating) around all trees, posts, and fencing. We edge all sidewalks, patios and driveways with a blade edger and clean up all of the trimmings. Both weekly and bi-weekly lawn mowing is available.

<h1>Core Aeration</h1>
Why aerate? Over time, lawns become compacted from heavy use; each time your pets, kids and others walk across or play on the lawn, all that foot traffic presses down on the soil, making it harder for the grass roots to take up water and other nutrients. That greatly reduces air pockets in your soil. Grass (and other roots) require oxygen to grow and absorb nutrients and water. When we aerate your lawn, we use a mechanical aerator that pulls out small plugs of soil from the lawn about one to two inches in length. This creates little air pockets that allow water, fertilizers and other nutrients to move to the root zone more easily. These air pockets improve the lawn’s ability to absorb rain and prevents fertilizers from running off the lawn surface. The soil plugs are left on the lawn, because they’ll eventually break down and work back into the soil.

<h1>Topdressing</h1>
Involves spreading a thin layer of compost on top of your lawn. Compost is great for building healthy soil in landscape and garden beds; the same is true for your lawn. Healthy lawns require healthy soil. We’ll rake a thin layer of compost over your lawn (with some filling the aeration holes), where it will gradually move to the soil below the grass. Top-dressing with compost helps soils use fertilizer more efficiently and adds nutrients. It’s a good idea to top-dress your lawn once a year to restore soil humus.

<h1>Organic Lawn Fertilization </h1>
We apply organic "Milorganite" fertilizer in the early spring(March-April),  early summer (June), early fall (September) and late fall/winter (November-December. Lawn fertilizers containing slow-release or organic forms of nitrogen furnish a steadier supply of nitrogen to the grass. When our four yearly applications are made in conjunction with our other lawn maintenance services an outstanding lawn will result.

Our product is safe to run, walk, play or crawl on immediately after application for pets and people alike!
